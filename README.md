Using TDA to predict Lottery Numbers

Hello,
I have been looking into Toplogical Data Analysis which summed up is the transforming of data into shapes in order to find hiiden patterns not noticed. I used this concept in a research to identify potential scams in financial data and thought, why not try it in predicting likely next draw lottery numbers.

Note: The CSV file that contains the past lottery draws needs to be updated otherwise, the predicted draw number are not be accurately (to the models best ability) correctly. And this was just a passion project, I'm not yet a millionaire -_-.
